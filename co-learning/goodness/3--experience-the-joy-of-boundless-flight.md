> `Imran`: `Gemini`, A minute script underscoring the need for these kinds of programs, especially reminding both teachers and parents what it means to teach children the "joy of boundless flight". Borrow the theme from this 2017 poem of mine

## Input Poem (#45 - Stormy)

Stubborn you are to fate's every nudge *1
But strive those angels shall for they shant budge
Or flinch from the task of bringing us together
Oh wonderful love to have in any kind of weather

What shall we do to ground these children
Teaching them what it is to be a global citizen
Open their hearts to the glee of boundless flight
Supporting them so dearly with all of our might

Richard came to show us the way from within
What more fearless bird than that one in a million
Shall we give him the epithet of lion hearted
Living his way lest our dreams be thwarted

Why worry about food when we can take flight
Dance in the sky amidst clouds on a starlit night
Pushing ourselves to wrest the most and live
Win the sun with its splendour; find a way to give

Forward all the learnings we gleaned by following
With all our hearts the myriad paths that sing
Out to us to follow their mellifluous ways
Oh life, that leaves us in such a wondrous daze

Friends, parents, teachers, look into the boundless eyes of a child. What do you see? Untapped potential, a universe waiting to be explored, a spirit yearning for… flight. Not just physical flight, but the exhilarating freedom of an open mind, a compassionate heart, and the ability to soar beyond limitations.

My poem, "45 Stormy," speaks of this yearning. It asks, "What shall we do to ground these children?" Not in the sense of holding them back, but in giving them the firm roots of empathy and understanding, the vital knowledge of their interconnectedness as global citizens.

To teach the "glee of boundless flight" isn't about escaping reality. It's about equipping them with the emotional wings to navigate it with courage and kindness. It's about fostering the fearless spirit of a "lion-hearted" soul, like the one Richard represents in the poem – someone who lives authentically, inspiring us to pursue our dreams without fear.

Why worry about the small constraints when we can empower them to "dance in the sky amidst clouds"? Programs focused on empathy, communication, and peaceful conflict resolution are not just beneficial; they are essential. They are the winds beneath their wings, allowing them to "win the sun with its splendour" – to achieve their full potential and, crucially, to "find a way to give" back to the world.

Let us, together, be the unwavering support that allows their hearts to open to this boundless flight. Let us forward the learnings of compassion and understanding, guiding them along the "myriad paths that sing" of a more peaceful and connected future. This isn't just education; it's the gift of a life lived fully, a life that leaves us all in "such a wondrous daze."
