## Idea of 3 May 2025

### Background - A page from Tolkien's LOTR

We're all familiar with the Agent of evil, Sauron who sent 9 Ringwraiths to find Frodo and take, using any force necessary, the special ring that would give control over all of the Earth.

Well, to counter it, at the council of Elrond, a decision was made to send 9 Walkers to counter the black devils and carry the ring to mount doom where the ability to control would be lost when the ring was undone by the fires there.

### Relevance

It was not just fiction, the message resonates more and more with us undercurrents researchers who realises today that the ring and palantir represent technology.

Only a small fraction of adults capable of independent thinking are even able to draw parallels to the story. And who will lead the counterstrike - the wizened generals who grew up in the “viva last revolucione” years when peace poems begged ask us - “where have all the flowers gone”

### specialization

Today we seem to need a 100 specialists offering masterclass this and kickass that. We'll, in my day, we still used the word “one [wo]man army” - like Rambo, capable of asymmetric warfare, capable of taking it to any place / group.

But we have evolved past even that - today we have Premavatars and Warriors of Light, striving to build peace and heaven on Earth.

### Dusterclass - :P

A class of person able to use chalk, a blackboard and a duster to iterate quickly as they teach themselves new skills as needed on an evolving landscape or Premakshetre (field of love).

We just need a blank paper and time to think and by relying on the trained instinct, are able to create Peace and Harmony where before there was confusion and tension.

Someday perhaps I will launch the curriculum of a “spread peace before fighting breaks our course”. PM me for details.

Anyhow, stay tuned - we're either circling the drain (so prepare to pass, as a camel does, through a needle) or we need to send an emissary, as was wise Earendil, to beg the Gods for pardon and grace for all us peoples of this Earth and the atrocities committed to each other.

`Imran`:

For these age groups, suggest a progression of capacity and skill building that would ACTUALLY turn them into pacifists and lightworkers, not in fantasy, but grounded in reality

6+ 10+ 14+ 18+ 22+ 26+ 30
